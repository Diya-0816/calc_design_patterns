## 🚀 Features  
- **Interactive REPL**: Users can input commands dynamically.  
- **Command Pattern Implementation**: Supports `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.  
- **Plugin Architecture**: New commands can be added without modifying the core code.  
- **100% Test Coverage**: All features are tested using `pytest`.
